## Portfolio website

I decided to make my own portfolio website, that is probably it.

I'm going to add a lot of interesting features in the closest future.

You can see what it looks like now here: http://www.mursvet.ru

## How to run?

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the
result.
